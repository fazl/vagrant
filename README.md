# vagrant
Take a look at vagrant, as the docker experience has been less than 'wow!' 

Just need to install virtualbox (already done due to docker) and download the windows msi (about200mb) and install that.

Looks like it seems free.. and.. there is an oreilly book out for it already

Never heard of Hashicorp .. but what does that mean

Ooops, the very first attempt from https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started :

	$ vagrant up
	The version of powershell currently installed on this host is less than
	the required minimum version. Please upgrade the installed version of
	powershell to the minimum required version and run the command again.

Guess I need to figure out impact of upgrading powershell, which I never use directly.
