# vagrant
Take a look at vagrant, as the docker experience has been less than 'wow!' 

Just need to install virtualbox (already done due to docker) and download the windows msi (about200mb) and install that.

Looks like there is an oreilly book out for it already, and .. it seems free.

Never heard of Hashicorp .. but what's new.

TIP: in a bash window export HISTCONTROL=erasedups
