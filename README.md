# vagrant
Take a look at vagrant, as the docker experience has been less than 'wow!' 

Just need to install virtualbox (already done due to docker) and download the windows msi (about200mb) and install that.

Looks like there is an oreilly book out for it already, and .. it seems free.

Never heard of Hashicorp .. but what's new.

TIP: in a bash window export HISTCONTROL=erasedups
TIP: to avoid always entering git creds can try this from stackover:
	git config credential.helper store
	git push https://github.com/owner/repo.git
	git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 7200'
TIP: run GitBash as admin before trying to change git config if it complains about not being able to lock a gitconfig file
